# Bandersnatch
ABAP version of an interactive movie Bandersnatch (Black Mirror) by Netflix in Russian.

In this game you basically make decisions following the instructions on a popup window.
The game has give main endings, with various variations. 
You can also find "secret" endings in certain cases. (Hint: you gotta pick several times)

I came up with this while I was learning ABAP. 
Thought I need something sort of fun( cause let's face it - ABAP can be so booooooring ) 
to practice on while trying to dive myself into this strange(to say the least) 
programming language.

So I used kinda old-school programming style 
(mainly because I was reading an old book by Kretschmer released in 1996! )

I also trid to add timers, as in the original movie on Netflix you have ony 10 sec to decide.
However I successfully failed at that.

Anyways, enjoy! It's fun to explore all the endings, especially if you enjoyed the movie.
